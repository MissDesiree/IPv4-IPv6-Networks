Assessment 2A: IPv4 and IPv6 Networks
Purpose
This part of the assessment will focus on IPv4 and IPv6.
Assessment Instructions
Respond to each of the following in an APA-formatted paper.
In a minimum half-page essay, outline the following three tunneling mechanisms:
The ISATAP tunneling mechanism includes its components, addressing, routing, and router configuration.
The 6to4 tunneling mechanism, including its components, addressing, routing, and communication procedures.
The Teredo tunneling system, including its components, addressing, routing, and processes.
In a minimum half-page essay formulate an innovative solution for an IPv6 deployment plan. Include a list of all the activities you need to do to accomplish your initiative. These activities should include an inventory of existing computers and network infrastructure, an inventory of current applications, the need to acquire IPv6 addresses, etc.

The Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP) is a protocol that helps connect devices using the older IPv4 standard to the newer IPv6 standard within a private network. It allows IPv6 packets to travel through an IPv4 network. ISATAP involves ISATAP hosts, ISATAP routers, and ISATAP addresses. ISATAP addressing uses an IPv4 address embedded within an IPv6 address. The Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol routers manage traffic, and ISATAP hosts configure their IPv6 addresses based on router advertisements. The Intra-Site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol uses standard IPv6 routing protocols, and setting it up involves enabling ISATAP interfaces and configuring routing policies.

The 6to4 tunneling helps connect IPv6 sites over the IPv4 internet without needing special tunnels. It puts IPv6 data inside IPv4 packets. It uses 6to4 routers, 6to4 relay routers, and 6to4 addresses. A 6to4 address comes from the IPv4 address and starts with 2002::/16, followed by the IPv4 address. Routing happens automatically using the 6to4 prefix, and data is sent by putting IPv6 data in IPv4 packets. Relay routers help 6to4 and regular IPv6 networks communicate. This method is important for moving from the old IPv4 system to the new IPv6 system. It helps IPv6 data travel through the existing IPv4 network without needing a lot of changes. In a 6to4 tunnel, an IPv4 address is put into an IPv6 address to show where the tunnel ends.

The Teredo tunneling system helps devices behind IPv4 NAT devices connect to the IPv6 network. It has three main parts: Teredo clients, Teredo servers, and Teredo relays. Teredo assigns IPv6 addresses that include the client's IPv4 address and UDP port number, starting with 2001::/32. In this system, clients first connect to Teredo servers using UDP connections to get IPv6 addresses. They can then communicate with other Teredo clients or native IPv6 hosts via Teredo relays. This process involves getting an address, putting IPv6 data in UDP/IPv4, and using NAT traversal to help communication from end to end.

To start using IPv6 in your organization, you need to take several important steps. First, make a list of all your network devices and applications to see which ones already work with IPv6 and which ones need to be updated. Then, get IPv6 addresses from a Regional Internet Registry and plan how to use them in your network. Next, you'll need to set up your network devices to support both IPv4 and IPv6 and update your routing protocols to work with IPv6. Your DNS and DHCP servers also need to be updated to handle IPv6 addresses. It's important to update your security policies to include IPv6 traffic and make sure your firewalls and intrusion detection systems can handle IPv6. You should also train your IT staff on how to use and troubleshoot IPv6. Before fully rolling out IPv6, test everything to make sure it's all working properly. Start by using IPv6 in less important parts of your organization and then move on to the more critical areas. Keep an eye on your network's performance and make sure everything is running smoothly. Finally, document the entire process and review how it went after you've finished. This will help you see what went well and what you can do better next time.
